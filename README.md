# Menu Solutions

The production version of my meal planning app Menu Solutions built using the Laravel Framework. It is no longer under active development but is still hosted so feel free to check it out.

## About

Menu Solutions is a web based menu planning tool enabling the modern family to eat a home cooked healthy diet. It allows users to add their family members along with their dietary requirements. The user then inputs each week who will be eating on each day and the time they have available to prepare a meal. My algorithm considers all of this information to generate a meal plan for the user with healthy simple recipes that suit everyone's needs. It also generates a shopping list containing all the required ingredients. 

I originally came up with the idea as an A-Level project which can be found here: [Menu Solutions Original](https://github.com/Jack-Corbett/Menu-Solutions-Original) and continued development from there. This lead to me pitching the idea at the University of Southampton and with the support of their on campus startup incubator Future Worlds developing it into a business idea. However due to time constraints and moving into the world of work I no longer have the time to develop the project further and use it as a showcase of my development skills.
